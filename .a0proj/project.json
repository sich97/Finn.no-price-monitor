{"title": "Finn.no price monitor", "description": "A python script that on each run loops through a list of user-specified URL's pointing to listings on the Norwegian Finn.no online marketplace. For each listing it parses the current price and stores this together with a timestamp. If the price of one or more listings has changes since the last run, an email will be sent containing relevant info on the listings that had its price change.", "instructions": "Use simple newline seperated textfile (urls.txt) for the listing URL's. Use json for storing the historical price data.  Assume Finn.no is written in Norwegian. The script should not have any internal state during runtime. Scheduling will be done by the user, meaning the scope for the script is to simply record the price of the listings on each URL, and then exit. The script should continue even if there are errors related to any URL. There are three categories of listings on Finn.no: realestate, mobility and recommerce. For realestate and mobility, use the price category \"Totalpris\", which means the combination of downpayment, remaining mortgage and fees. For recommerce there is only one price category, usually the number next to \"Til salgs\". SMTP variables for the email alerting must be loaded either from environment variables or a config file, where environment variables take precedence.\n\nAlways delegate concrete coding tasks to a Developer subordinate unless told otherwise.\n\nKeep track of the project in an AGENTS.md file containing:\n1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test\n2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc\n3. Overarching project plan and a detailed list of implemented features as well as not yet implemented features\n\nThis file will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 150 lines long.", "color": "#002975ff", "git_url": "", "memory": "own", "file_structure": {"enabled": true, "max_depth": 5, "max_files": 20, "max_folders": 20, "max_lines": 250, "gitignore": "# A0 project meta folder\n.a0proj/\n\n# Python environments & cache\nvenv/\n**/__pycache__/\n\n# Node.js dependencies\n**/node_modules/\n**/.npm/\n\n# Version control metadata\n**/.git/\n"}}
